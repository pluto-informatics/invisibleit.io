# Welcome to Invisible IT Community

Many actions of Architects, Site Reliability/DevOps/Security/Network/... Engineers related to datacenter & cloud infrastructure and back-end services are invisible for end-users, especially high-quality actions.

At the same time, enterprise LOB applications need to land on a reliable and secure platform.

The objective of this community project is to provide solutions, tools, materials, and documentation for high-quality commercial IT consulting and support services for Enterprise Platforms with a focus on business cases:

- **PLATFORM FOUNDATION**:    How to unlock the potential of the company's IT?
- **PLATFORM VALUE**:         How to ensure and increase the company's IT added value?
- **PLATFORM OPTIMISATION**:  How to optimize operational costs and time of the company's IT?
- **PLATFORM SECURITY**:      How to respect compliance and privacy policies and minimize security risks & threats related to the company's IT?

Each question is essential for any company and requires a number of decisions and solutions to be applied.

Feel free to use it for your own business.
